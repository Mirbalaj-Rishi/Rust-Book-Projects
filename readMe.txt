This is a repository for any code I write while following the book "The Rust Programming Language" by by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, and Chris Krycho, with contributions from the Rust Community
The book is avaliable right here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html

Please note some of the code is taken directly from the book, while other pieces of code where written by me.
